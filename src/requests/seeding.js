Using a little of the chorizo drippings, stir-fry the shrimp lightly. Make sure to not overcook the shrimp by leaving them in the pan too long. When ready, remove and set aside.  Next, add the olive oil to your skillet and sautÃ© the garlic with the diced bell peppers (red, green and yellow.) Then add the rice, fried chorizo and the water. Sprinkle the packages or cubes of yellow rice seasoning over the mixture, along with the salt and pepper. Stir with a wooden spoon, then lower the heat and cover the pan. Let the rice simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. When the mixture is almost finished, add the shrimp and frozen peas. Replace the lid and continue cooking for a few more minutes. Serve hot, accompanied by a fresh green salad.',

            "First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices. Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth. Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 - 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they'll be served on since they'll shrink a bit in the cooking process. Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty, so they don't puff up while cooking. You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed. Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.",
